/**
 * The result type every repository returns.
 *
 * Two kinds of failure are surfaced separately on purpose:
 *  - [error] is a rule the member can fix in the form (invalid email, password
 *    too short, round needs two ideas, owner-only);
 *  - [kind] explains the transport or server answer, including
 *    [ApiErrorKind.CONFLICT] for "somebody else changed this while you were
 *    offline" and [ApiErrorKind.NETWORK] for a queued offline change.
 *
 * The UI turns either into a concrete next action, which is one of the PoE's
 * non-functional requirements ("errors must explain the next action").
