/**
 * "Decide For Us": the progressive YES/NO decision game.
 *
 * Rules implemented here (design document, section 2 and 3):
 *  - every eligible activity enters a round; each member casts one YES/NO vote
 *    per activity, so every voice carries exactly the same weight;
 *  - an activity progresses when it has more YES than NO votes;
 *  - an activity that can no longer reach a majority drops out ("weak options
 *    are removed");
 *  - nothing is revealed to the group until the round closes;
 *  - survivors go into the next round until one winner remains, and the final
 *    comparison is the last round that still has more than one survivor;
 *  - a round can be closed early the moment only one activity could still win.
 *
 * The engine is pure: hand it the round, the members and the votes, and it
 * returns the outcome. The same rules are mirrored by the ASP.NET Core API
 * (`api-container/Services/DecisionService.cs`) so the server and the offline
 * cache can never disagree about who won.
